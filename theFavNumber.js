Hereâ€™s a simple JavaScript solution for your "Favorite Number Calculation" problem. This code declares a favorite number, prompts the user to guess it, and provides feedback until they guess correctly.

// Declare a variable to hold the favorite number
const favNumber = 7; // Change this to your actual favorite number

// Initialize a variable to hold the user's guess
let userGuess;

// While loop to prompt the user until they guess correctly
while (userGuess !== favNumber) {
    // Prompt the user to enter their guess
    userGuess = parseInt(prompt("Guess my favorite number:"));

    // Check if the guess is too high, too low, or correct
    if (userGuess < favNumber) {
        console.log("Too low! Try again.");
    } else if (userGuess > favNumber) {
        console.log("Too high! Try again.");
    } else {
        console.log("Correct! Well done.");
    }
}
